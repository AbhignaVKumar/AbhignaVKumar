### 🚀 Projects Highlight  
- **👓 Smart Surgical Glasses:**  
  Developed standalone smart glasses streaming a surgeon’s first-person view wirelessly using Nicla Vision.  
  Deployed ML speech recognition on ARM Cortex M7 for voice-controlled video streaming.  

- **🛰️ BOEING Navigation System:**  
  Built a wearable for aircraft navigation assistance using haptic feedback and computer vision (April Tags).  
  Enabled seat-to-lavatory localization with hybrid audio-haptic feedback for low-visibility conditions.  

- **📶 DyMAC – Dynamic MAC Protocol:**  
  Co-designed and implemented the first IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH MAC on a commercial radio (ADF7030-1).  
  Created custom firmware APIs for MAC/PHY, synchronization, and multi-hop mesh networks.  

- **🔐 Git450 Platform:**  
  Designed a Git-like platform with client-server authentication, encryption, and repository management.  
  Developed multi-server architecture (Auth, Repo, Deployment) with secure UDP/TCP communication.
